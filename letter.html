<h1>Happy Valentine’s Day, Pa ❤️</h1>

<p>
Even though we are miles apart,
my heart is always with you.
Distance has only made me understand
how precious you are to me.
</p>

<p>
I know trust takes time.
And I want you to know —
I am choosing honesty.
I am choosing loyalty.
I am choosing you.
</p>

<p>
Not just today,
but every single day.
</p>

<p>
You are my peace.
My comfort.
My home.
</p>

<p>
Happy Valentine’s Day, Pa.
Thank you for loving me.
