    <h2>To My Pa ❤️</h2>

    <p>Pa…</p>

    <p>
      I know I’m not perfect. I know I’ve made mistakes that hurt you deeply.
      And I carry that in my heart every single day.
    </p>

    <p>
      But even after everything, you chose to stay.
      You chose to love me when it would’ve been easier to walk away.
      That means more to me than words can ever explain.
    </p>

    <p>
      This distance hurts sometimes…
      but my heart has never left you.
      Every day, I choose you again.
    </p>

    <p>
      Thank you for loving me through my flaws.
      You are my comfort, my safe place, my forever.
    </p>
