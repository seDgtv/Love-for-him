  <h1>For You, Pa ❤️</h1>

  <p>Pa…</p>

  <p>
  I know I’m not perfect. I know I’ve made mistakes that hurt you deeply.
  And I carry that in my heart every single day.
  </p>

  <p>
  But even after everything, you chose to stay.
  You chose to love me when it would’ve been easier to walk away.
  And that means more to me than words could ever explain.
  </p>

  <p>
  This distance hurts sometimes, Pa…
  But my heart has never left you. Not for a second.
  Every day I wake up choosing you.
  Every day I am grateful that you are mine.
  </p>

  <p>
  Thank you for being patient with me.
  Thank you for loving me even when I didn’t love myself properly.
  You are my safe place. My comfort. My home.
  </p>

  <p>
  I promise to love you better.
  More honestly. More gently. More deeply.
  </p>

  <p>
  I love you, Pa. ❤️ <br>
  Always.
